# kim-kardashian-website

Create a stylish and modern home page for Kim Kardashian's personal website with the following elements:

- A full-width hero section with a professional photo of Kim and a short tagline introduction. Give this section a light colored background.
- Below the hero, add a brief bio section with 2-3 paragraphs summarizing Kim's background and career. 
- Include a section with links to Kim's social media profiles, using the appropriate icons for each (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook).
- Use a sleek, modern design style with a neutral color scheme (whites, greys, black). 
- Add a navbar at the top with links to Home, About, Projects, Gallery, and Contact. 
- Include a footer with a copyright notice.

For the content, use placeholder text for now, as the real bio details are not available. The goal is to establish the overall design direction and layout.
